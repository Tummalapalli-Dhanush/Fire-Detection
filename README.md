Fire Detection is a system that uses advanced deep learning models (YOLO-v5 and Inception-v3) to quickly detect and monitor forest fires at an early stage. By providing timely alerts, it helps fire authorities respond faster, reducing damage to life, property, and forest ecosystems. This system ensures accurate and reliable fire detection, supporting sustainability and forest protection efforts.
